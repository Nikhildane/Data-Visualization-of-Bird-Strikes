# Data-Visualization-of-Bird-Strikes
This project involves the data visualization of bird strikes involving aircraft in the United States from 2000 to 2011. It aims to analyze various aspects of these incidents, such as their frequency, the airlines and airports most affected, the costs incurred, and the phases of flight during which they are most common.
